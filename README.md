 # Class Size vs. Software Maintainability

## Abstract
This project investigates the impact of class size on software maintainability in Java projects. We analyze the relationship between class size and maintainability metrics using the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics suite. The goal is to provide insights into best practices for software design and development.

## Overview
This study explores how class size affects software maintainability by examining Java projects from GitHub. We use the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) paradigm and CKJM tool to evaluate maintainability metrics such as Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) and Coupling Between Objects (CBO).

## Results
Our analysis reveals a positive correlation between class size, complexity, and coupling metrics. Larger classes tend to have higher WMC and CBO values, indicating decreased maintainability.

## Recommendations
To improve maintainability:
- Embrace modular design and design patterns to limit class size.
- Conduct regular code reviews and refactoring sessions.
- Utilize automated static analysis tools for maintainability tracking.
